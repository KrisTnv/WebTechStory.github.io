				<p><p>Months have passed, but you can't stop thinking about your meeting with the "ghost". You decide to start researching
				<br> <br>and find the location of that cave and explore what's inside. Eventually you come across an ancient rune which when placed under moonlight, shows the location
				<br> <br>of the thing you desire most. You immediately pack your stuff and set off. You find the cave in the middle of a desert and it looks exactly as described in the book.
				<br> <br>You send a few prayers before going in, not knowing what you might stumble across. As soon as you walk in, a giant rock falls behind you and blocks your way out.
				<br> <br>You have no other option but to go down the giant staircase that has appeared in fron of you. The deeper you go, the colder it gets. After a couple of hours
				<br> <br>you still haven't reached the bottom, you get dizzy and pass out. The next thing you see after you wake up is the giant fire breathers sitting around the stone,
				<br> <br>but something isn't right. They don't even acknowledge your presence and it seems like something has possessed them. You slowly approach the stone which 
				<br> <br>is placed on a big pile of skulls. It looks horrific. All of a sudden, you start hearing voices which get louder and louder as if like they are trying to 
				<br> <br>drive you crazy. Trying to cover your ears, you stumble and push the stone out of its position. It falls right on your chest.</p>
