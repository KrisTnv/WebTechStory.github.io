			<br> <br>castle's library which says that this weapon posseses powers that have never been seen in this world. But in order to make the first step to finding
			<br> <br>it, you must go back to Alonsus Faol who once was the teacher of Agrammar - A powerful creature that betrayed this weapon and it's own people and dedicated itself
			<br> <br>to the dark side.</p>
