			<p><p>You don't like this nasty creature's plans! You grew up around the people of the Flying City and you don't want to 
			<br> <br>harm them. You declare this to Agrammar and he isn't happy. He starts channeling his shadow blast on you but you are built different and it is going to take 
			<br> <br>a lot more than a simple spell to take you out. You both start casting powerful magic upon each other. The fight lasts for hours. Then you remember his biggest
			<br> <br>weakness - The Shadow Dagger which once courrupted him and made him the creature he is now. You take it out and open the book. There is a spell called Unfurling Darkness.
			<br> <br>The most powerful spell that can ever be casted upon someone. You start reading, but it is not that easy. Agrammar summons his fiends. They start casting even
			<br> <br>more spells upon you, but right at the end of your strength you cast Unfurling Darkness. All of a sudden every single demon around you turns into ashes and Agrammar
			<br> <br>falls to his knees. Seeing that, you take your dagger out for one last time and behead him. His cold body crashes on the ground and turns into dust. You have
			<br> <br>just killed the world's biggest enemy!</p>
