				<p><p>You decide to pursue the darkest weapon in the priest world, The Shadow Dagger. You find a book in the 
				<br> <br>castle's library which says that this weapon posseses powers that have never been seen in this world. But in order to make the first step to finding
				<br> <br>it, you must talk to a ghost that once was the last owner of the Shadow Dagger. You have to carefully listen to his instructions, because if the weapon
				<br> <br>falls in the wrong hands, there will be consequences around the whole world.</p>
