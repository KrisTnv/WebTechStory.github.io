				<p><p> The book said that in order to talk to that ghost you have to be in the right place at the right time.
				<br> <br>But where is that place, you might ask. At the end of the page there are coordinates which lead to the castle's backyard. You immediately close the book
				<br> <br>and run outside. All of a sudden the ground starts shaking and you see a dark figure appear out of nowhere. But it is not a ghost, it is something much
				<br> <br>different and far more powerful. It is a shadow that can take different shapes and forms and has no physical presence. You slowly put your hand towards it trying
				<br> <br>to make contact but as soon as you reach out you start having visions. That is the creature talking to you. In your visions you see a big cave full of 
				<br> <br>dragons and they all seem to be gathering around some kind of a stone as if like they are protecting it. From the outside, the cave is surrounded by an infinite
				<br> <br>number of sand watches and it seems that they are all showing the same time. Then your vision ends and the dark creature vanishes.</p>
