			<p><p> You join Agrammar's forces and begin your march towards the Flying City. You are his right hand. The legion
			<br> <br>takes the portal from the midlands and arrives at the front gate. An epic battle begins, but your forces are overwhelming and you break through the main gates.
			<br> <br>No one can stop you and your Shadow Dagger. You begin casting your Shadow Form and transform into everyone's biggest fear. Some see you as a giant spider, some see
			<br> <br>you as their worst nightmare - DEATH! The Flying City is now yours to control. You settle down and begin your plans to take over the whole world. You are IMMORTAL!</p>
