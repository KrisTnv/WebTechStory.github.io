			<p><p>You summon a portal and travel to Dalaran - The Flying City. When you arrive there, you see the streets overwhelmed with 
			<br> <br>dead bodies. You come across an old man sitting on the porch in front of his burning house. You ask him what happened and he says that a powerful shadow
			<br> <br>weighs upon Dalaran and is killing every living thing in it's path. He says that if no one comes with reinforcements, the city will be taken over. All of a sudden,
			<br> <br>seing that you hold the Light's Wrath, Agrammar comes out of the shadows and says that even with the most sacred weapon no one will be able to stop him. 
			<br> <br>He reveals his cruel plan on how to take over the Flying City and then the whole world.</p>
