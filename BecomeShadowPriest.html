			<p><p>You try to pick up the stone but it won't move. It is now stuck on you. You slowly get up and you see that 
			<br> <br>something is happening to you. Your skin becomes transparent and in front of you there is a book with the Shadow Dagger sitting on top of it.
			<br> <br>You pick the dagger up and the book opens. The same shadow you encountered in the castle's backyard comes out of it, but now things are different. 
			<br> <br>You have transformed into a shadow priest and you speak it's language. It presents itself as Agrammar. Once a powerful titan protecting the 
			<br> <br>world from the corruption of the Dark Legion, but things go wrong when he finds the Dark Stone and it corrupts him. You listen to his story and his plan to 
			<br> <br>kill everyone in the flying city and take over his homeland. He offers you an opportunity to join him and his army and once the flying city has been wiped he wants to continue
			<br> <br>corrupting everything in his path until the entire world has been swallowed by shadows.</p>
